ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea/
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/encodings.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/wechat_sdk_sample_android.iml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* debug.keystore

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/libammsdk.jar => app/libs/libammsdk.jar
* libs/wechat-sdk-android-with-mta-1.0.2.jar => app/libs/wechat-sdk-android-with-mta-1.0.2.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/net/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/net/.DS_Store
* src/net/sourceforge/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/net/sourceforge/.DS_Store
* src/net/sourceforge/simcpux/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/net/sourceforge/simcpux/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
